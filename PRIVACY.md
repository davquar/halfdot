# Privacy Policy

I (Davide Quaranta) built the HalfDot app as an Open Source app. This Service is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform users regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

## Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using the app, certain personally identifiable information may be requested, including but not limited to: (1) Umami instance URL; (2) username; (3) password. Such information is sent to the provided Umami instance URL for login purposes only. After a successful login, the aforementioned URL and username, plus the authentication token provided by Umami, **are retained on the device and are not collected by me in any way**.

## Log Data

I want to inform you that whenever you use the app, in a case of an error in the app I may collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app, the time and date of error, and other statistics.

## Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This app does not use "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

## Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

*   To facilitate the Service;
*   To provide the Service on my behalf;
*   To perform Service-related services; or
*   To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

The Umami instance URL that you provide is a service provider. While you interact with the app, data is requested and obtained from the Umami instance.

## Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.


## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2022-11-04.
